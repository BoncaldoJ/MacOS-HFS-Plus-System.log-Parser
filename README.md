# MacOS-HFS-Plus-System.log-Parser
This is a simple python script that parses the Pre-APFS system.log file and outputs it to an sqlite database.

This program will ask you two things:
  1). Where you want the output file
  2). Where the system.log file is located
Be sure to supply an absolute path with filenames and extensions.
The hostname will not be parsed out of the log files.
